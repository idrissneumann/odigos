## Configuring Quickwit Backend

The only required field is the Quickwit endpoint which is supporting OTLP grpc (it remain the same http endpoint used for the Quickwit RESTful API).
This endpoint must be a valid URL for your Quickwit cluster, i.e: `http://{quickwit_host}:7281`

You'll find more details here: https://quickwit.io/docs/log-management/otel-service
